Goal: Minimize Cost
Objective Function: (500*num_drivers) + total_number_of_driven_minutes
Constraints: Within 12 hours for each driver to get from start to finish
Observations:
    Fastest way to get to each point and back from (0,0) is a straight line
        since driver penalty is 500 this is not always best solution
Tools:
    Tool |  Issues, things to learn, etc.

    TSP                        | Constraints, factors other than distance
    GA                         | Need to find way to model constraints, good python library (scipy?). Have to come up with initial guess within constraints every time
    SA                         | Same as GA 
    ACO                        | Research Algorithm, probably similar to ^^
    Write my own heuristic     | Runtime, time consuming
